# U-Disc-Track

**Mapping Musical Encounters in Seattle’s University District**

U-Disc-Track is a geovisualization project that maps everyday musical encounters throughout Seattle’s University District. The visualization explores how sound influences our emotions, how personal identity shapes what we notice, and how music interacts with our experience of place.

This project was created for **UW HONORS Critical-Creative Geovisualization** (Autumn 2025).  
Team members: Alexis M., Daniel Z., Jasmine Z., Jordan C., Ruth W.  
Instructor: Prof. Jin-Kyu Jung

## 📝 Project Overview

Over the course of one week, our team recorded musical moments we encountered while moving through the University District. For each moment, we collected:

- **Location**
- **Context** (source, situation, genre when known)
- **Emotional reaction**
- **Short audio clip**

Our goals were to understand:

- How environmental music shapes emotional experience
- How personal backgrounds and moods affect what each person notices
- How found music differs from intentionally chosen music

The project emphasizes paying attention to the soundscapes that normally fade into the background of daily life.

## 🗺️ How the Visualization Works

The final map was built using **Leaflet**, with custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  
Each point on the map contains:

- A colored circle marker representing emotional tone
- A popup with:
  - Title and description
  - A short reflection
  - An embedded audio clip

The basemap uses Carto for a clean, minimal visual style.  
Audio files were first collected in Google Drive and attributes were collected in Google My Maps before both were integrated into this repository.

## 🎧 Key Findings

Our reflections revealed several patterns:

### **1. Emotional Trends**

- **Joy** was the most common emotional reaction.
- Quiet or low-traffic areas produced **more consistent emotions** (often calmness or contentment).
- Busy spaces like Red Square or the Ave produced **more varied emotional responses**.

### **2. Influence of Environment**

- The physical setting often shaped the emotional experience **more strongly than the music itself**.
- Ambient noises—rain, chatter, traffic, footsteps—contributed as much to the mood as the music.

### **3. Identity & Background**

- Team members often noticed music that resonated with their cultural background, musical taste, or personal routine.
- Accidental listening frequently introduced **new or unexpected moods**, different from the music we might choose ourselves.

### **4. Types of Moments**

We saw three recurring categories:

- **Connection** — recognizing humanity through shared sound
- **Comfort** — calming or grounding moments from ambient music
- **Memory triggers** — past experiences linked to sounds or genres

## 🔧 Future Improvements

Potential next steps for the project include:

- More nuanced emotional categories (e.g., types of joy or types of calm)
- Incorporating non-musical environmental sounds as their own layer
- Adding filters for:
  - Time of day
  - Weather
  - Social density of the environment
- Expanding the dataset beyond one week or beyond the University District
