                Every day, we move through spaces shaped by music. We hear playlists in stores and
                cafés, fragments of songs from passing cars and open windows, and tracks we choose
                for ourselves as we walk and study. Music is everywhere in the University District,
                yet we rarely pause to consider how these sounds influence us– or how we, in turn,
                influence the music in our surroundings.

                The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between environmental
                music, personal emotion, and spatial experience. We want to understand not only how
                the music we consume affects our mental state, but also how the mood of a location
                influences the sounds chosen, played, or amplified there.
